Dictdiffer is a helper module that helps you to diff and patch
dictionaries.

Installation
============

Dictdiffer is on PyPI so all you need is:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install dictdiffer


Usage
=====

Let's start with an example on how to find the diff between two
dictionaries using :func:`.diff` method:

.. code-block:: python

    from dictdiffer import diff, patch, swap, revert

    first = {
        "title": "hello",
        "fork_count": 20,
        "stargazers": ["/users/20", "/users/30"],
        "settings": {
            "assignees": [100, 101, 201],
        }
    }

    second = {
        "title": "hellooo",
        "fork_count": 20,
        "stargazers": ["/users/20", "/users/30", "/users/40"],
        "settings": {
            "assignees": [100, 101, 202],
        }
    }

    result = diff(first, second)

    assert list(result) == [
        ('change', ['settings', 'assignees', 2], (201, 202)),
        ('add', 'stargazers', [(2, '/users/40')]),
        ('change', 'title', ('hello', 'hellooo'))]


Now we can apply the diff result with :func:`.patch` method:

.. code-block:: python

    result = diff(first, second)
    patched = patch(result, first)

    assert patched == second


Also we can swap the diff result with :func:`.swap` method:

.. code-block:: python

    result = diff(first, second)
    swapped = swap(result)

    assert list(swapped) == [
        ('change', ['settings', 'assignees', 2], (202, 201)),
        ('remove', 'stargazers', [(2, '/users/40')]),
        ('change', 'title', ('hellooo', 'hello'))]


Let's revert the last changes:

.. code-block:: python

    result = diff(first, second)
    reverted = revert(result, patched)
    assert reverted == first

A tolerance can be used to consider closed values as equal.
The tolerance parameter only applies for int and float.

Let's try with a tolerance of 10% with the values 10 and 10.5:

.. code-block:: python

    first = {'a': 10.0}
    second = {'a': 10.5}

    result = diff(first, second, tolerance=0.1)

    assert list(result) == []

Now with a tolerance of 1%:

.. code-block:: python

    result = diff(first, second, tolerance=0.01)

    assert list(result) == ('change', 'a', (10.0, 10.5))

Migrating patches after renaming fields
=======================================

When nested fields are renamed, patches accumulated against the old schema
still point at the old paths. :func:`dictdiffer.migrate_patches` rewrites
only the paths according to an explicit old-to-new mapping. Path segments
keep their type (string keys and integer list indices), and every entry is
interpreted against the original path, so parent migrations, name swaps and
the most-specific-prefix rule all work:

.. code-block:: python

    from dictdiffer import diff, migrate_patches

    mapping = {
        ('profile', 'name'): ('identity', 'display_name'),
    }

    old_patches = list(diff(
        {'profile': {'name': 'Ada'}},
        {'profile': {'name': 'Grace'}},
        dot_notation=False))

    migrate_patches(old_patches, mapping)
    # [('change', ['identity', 'display_name'], ('Ada', 'Grace'))]

Ambiguous or context-losing mappings raise
 :class:`dictdiffer.MigrationError` with one of the ``invalid_mapping``,
``target_collision``, ``mapping_cycle`` or ``lost_context`` codes, before
any migrated patch is returned.
